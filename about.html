                <p class = "about-me">My name is Guillermo Garcia, and I was born in Maracay, Venezuela. Currently, I am a software engineer in the making. I am that guy always smiling in the street, it doesn't matter circumstances.
                    I consider myself a creative, friendly and outgoing person; making people laugh always makes my day. Also a hard worker; it does not matter the type of work. Although I am not a perfectionist, I believe there is always room to improve in a project on your life in general.  
                </p>
                <p class = "about-me">I am an avid sports fan. I pretty much find all sports entertaining, but soccer is the king of sports in my opinion. As a sports fan, I pretty much play every single sports video game available. My favorite video game is "EA Sports - FIFA", but it can be frustrating at times.
                </p>
                <p class = "about-me">My interest in technology first came when my parents bought me a Playstation 2. I've always found fascinanting how someone using a computer could create a whole new world inside a small console.
                    Since then, I've always wanted to learn how to make a "NEW WORLD" myself. So, if you want to take a look into my world, please check my <a href="portfolio.html">PORTFOLIO</a> page. I hope you find a lot of fascinating projects as I once did. </p>
